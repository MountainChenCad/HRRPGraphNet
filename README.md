# HRRPGraphNet
We got accepted to IET Electronics Letters!
HRRPGraphNet is a deep learning model for processing HRRP data using graph neural networksðŸ’¥.

## Usage

To train and test the model, run `main.py`.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.8
- PyTorch 2.2.0

## Dataset

The dataset should be organized in the `data/` directory with the following structure:

```
data/
â”œâ”€â”€ train/
â””â”€â”€ test/
```

## Model

The model is defined in `models.py` and consists of convolutional layers followed by graph convolutional layers.
